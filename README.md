Overview

This project is an IoT-based EV Battery Management System (BMS) that monitors battery health, state of charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), temperature, and other key parameters. The system sends real-time data to the cloud for remote monitoring, predictive maintenance, and performance optimization.

Features

✅ Real-time monitoring of battery voltage, current, and temperature
✅ State of Charge (SoC) and State of Health (SoH) estimation
✅ Cloud-based data logging and visualization
✅ Smart alerts for overheating, overcharging, and low battery
✅ Predictive maintenance and fault detection
✅ Web dashboard / mobile app integration
